   <h4> What are the cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying decision-making?   If morals are taught, how can we create paradigms to reflect multifaceted learning strategies? How does common-sense knowledge play a role in decision-making? The cognitive and neural mechanisms underlying decision-making are constantly being studied in order to develop better machine learning methods that can help computers make more accurate decisions. Furthermore, research is being conducted on how common-sense knowledge plays a role in decision-making. We focus on developing and applying computational models to understand how people make decisions. Our interdisciplinary research covers a wide range of topics, from causal cognition in how people reason about moral problems to how they learn and use common-sense knowledge. </h4>

    <span>Behind Clubhouse’s Trajectory and Phenom
    </span>
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <p>Clubhouse is an auditory app that allows users to host various rooms surrounding a diverse range of topics from Artificial Intelligence to Philosophy. Along with its educational and serene approach, it is known for its popularity amongst celebrities, including Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerburg, CEO of Shopify, and its elusive invite and ios-only pass into gaining access into Clubhouse. Waiting lists are available in the case of not achieving an invite, but to further speed the process, various sellers on eBay, Reddit, Twitter, etc., charging invites from 10−200. This research paper covers the phenomenon of Clubhouse and the emergence of audio-only rooms, along with a hypothesis of why Clubhouse and other apps of a similar kind are experiencing a harsh downfall despite its seemingly successful business model.</p>

    <span>The Role of Perception in Language Comprehension 
    </span>
    <div class="language-content">
      <p>In ”Language Comprehenders Mentally Represent the Shapes of Objects Represent the Shapes of Objects,” Rolf A. Zwaan and colleagues hypothesized that perceptual symbols are frequently engaged in the process of understanding language. In the field of cognitive science, a number of studies have been conducted in order to address the phenomenon associated with language comprehension, and new ideas have been put forth, including one proposing that lexical decisions are formed based on simulation of perceptual experience. A new phenomenon known as the action-sentence compatibility effect (ACE) was also discovered by Glenberg and Kaschak in their paper ”Grounding language in action”. The researchers found that language understanding is grounded in bodily action, further illustrating the idea that at least some language comprehension is similar to this since language was probably developed to facilitate the coordination of actions. While there has been some discussion of a perceptual approach to language understanding in the past, it has not addressed the theoretical and empirical implications of such a perspective, nor has it addressed the concept of embodied language processing. An important contribution of this literature review is that it provides an updated version of previous work in cognitive science, shedding more light on the role attributed to perception in language comprehension, as well as on the empirical and theoretical implications of the role attributed to perception. This literature study, in addition to being of use to researchers and academics, may prove to be of practical benefit to anyone seeking knowledge regarding the function that the motor system plays in language understanding

    <span>Artificial Intelligence in the Health Care Industry
    </span>
    <div class="health-content">
<p>As the technological landscape grows, various machine learning algorithms have been implemented in the health care industry. The use of machine learning methods has been soaring in the healthcare sector because of their ability to analyze massive amounts of data in a concise amount of time. In the absence of humans, machine learning can detect patterns that humans do not easily see. Furthermore, machine learning methods can identify trends relevant to the detection of the root cause of certain diseases.  Healthcare practitioners are using artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics to identify the root cause of diseases, the diagnosis of diseases, and the prognosis of diseases. With these methods, healthcare practitioners can prevent diseases, promote healthier living, and save more patients' lives. However, statistical and social bias in artificial intelligence and its implications for health care is becoming common. The method to investigate this issue involved utilizing artificial intelligence to detect prejudice since it can find treatments that can rectify biased clinician decision-making and possibly decrease health inequalities. The first part will address the paper "Addressing Bias in Artificial Intelligence in Health Care" (Parikh et al., 2019) and the various negative implications of utilizing AI in the health care industry. The second section of the paper will cover the role and influence of five kinds of machine learning algorithms, which are commonly found in health care (Artificial Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines)
